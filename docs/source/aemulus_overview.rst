Aemulus Project
================

The Aemulus Project is a suite of 75 large-scale dark-matter-only cosmological boxes which span a wide range of cosmologies (1 Gpc/h boxes with 1400\ :sup:`3` particles). It is designed to allow algorithms to learn the connection between cosmological parameters and mock observables.

The main `Aemulus Project <https://aemulusproject.github.io>`_ website contains public data and analysis code as well as links to the main papers written by the Aemulus team.
