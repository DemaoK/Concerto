Zoom-in Simulations
===================

"Zoom-in" simulations are designed to study individual halos at high resolutions. To do this, researchers run a large but low-resolution simulation, identify an interesting halo, and rerun the simulation with additional resolution added to the region which will eventually become that halo.

This site currently hosts two sets of zoom-in simulations. The :doc:`Symphony <symphony_overview>` simulation suite is a collection of five differetn smaller zoom-in simulations suites which cover masses ranging from LMC-mass dawrf galaxies to very high mass galaxy clusters. The Milky Way-est suite is a set of Milky-Way-mass dark matter halos which have been selected to match large mergers which were similar to thos experienced by the actual Milky Way.
