The Symlib Analaysis Library
============================

``symlib`` is a data analysis library initially created for the :doc:`Symphony <symphony_overview>` suite of simulations and has also been run on the :doc:`Milky Way-est <mwest_overview>` simulations. The library uses custom file formats and functions to reduce the size of files, to speed up common common tasks, and to make some common tasks easier. ``symlib`` also contains functions which make it easy to download the datsets hosted on this site.

The easiest way to learn this library is to go through our tutorials, which include code examples and practive problems. Essentially all users will want to read the :doc:`Subhalo Tutorial <working_with_subhalos>` which covers the most important functions in the library. Users interested in particle analysis should read the :doc:`Particle Tutorial <working_with_particles>`. Some niche users may also want to read the :doc:`Merger Tree Tutorial <working_with_trees>`, although this will usually not be neccessary, as the standard subhalo analysis tutorial will allow you to perform the vast majority of subhalo evolution analysis already. A `quickstart <quickstart>` page is available for users interested in starting quickly, although we recommend at least doing the subhalo tutorial.

The `Symlib Documentation` page contains full formal descriptions of all ``symlib`` functions.
