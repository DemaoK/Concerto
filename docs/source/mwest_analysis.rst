Milky Way-est Analysis Notebooks
=======================================

Overview
----------------

This page contains tutorials for performing analysis on the Milky Way-est suite. To use them, you'll need be able to load an iPython / `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/install>`_ notebook (.ipynb), and you'll need to have Python 3 installed (such as via `Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html>`_), along with a few other packages (e.g., `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_, `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_) described in the notebooks directly.

   .. tab-item:: Getting Started

      In order to help you get started with the specialized Milky Way-est data beyond the standard :doc:`symlib <symlib>` datasets, we've put together a short tutorial with instructions on loading the main branches for the MW-like host halo, LMC analog, and GSE analog for each halo in our suite. (We make use of `Yao-Yuan Mao's helper function library <https://bitbucket.org/yymao/helpers/src/master/helpers/SimulationAnalysis.py>`_, which contains scripts and functions to easily process the files we'll be working with.) The notebook will walk you through everything you need to do to get set up for analysis, and you can download it here: :download:`getting_started_mwest.ipynb <getting_started_mwest.ipynb>`. You can then load the notebook by navigating to the download location on your machine and typing ``jupyter notebook`` within that directory.
