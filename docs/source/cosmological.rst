Cosmological Simulations
========================

The GFC croup has run several large-scale, publicly accessible "cosmological" simulation boxes. These boxes are generally targeted at making preictions for large galaxy surveys and fill a different niche than zoom-in simulations, which focus on making higher accuracy predictions for indivudal dark matter halos.

This site contains information and links to the :doc:`Aemulus Project <aemulus_overview>`, :doc:`Dark Skies <dark_skies_overview>`, and :doc:`Buzzard/Cardinal <buzzard_overview>`. Each of these simulations has external webpages. Requests about these projects should be directed to the current maintainers of those pages.
