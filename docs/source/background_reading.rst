Background Reading
==================

Simulations can be a complicated subject and may be intimidating to students and other first-time users. This page contains links to papers, lectures, and other resources that we have found helpful for learning about simulations, dark matter, and cosmology.

Cosmology Background Reading
----------------------------

When first starting to learn about cosmology, it's nice to get a bird's eye view before delving into technical specifics. The Wikipedia pages on `dark matter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter>`__ and the cosmological model `Lambda-CDM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model>`__ are good overviews, although be warned that as you get to the ends of these articles, you are more likely to be reading about the personal interests of individual editors rather than the consensus of experts. This is especially true for many of the topics listed as "challenges" on the Lambda-CDM page. 

These review notes by `Olive & Peacock <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/bigbangrpp.pdf>`__ (up to section 19.2.3) serve as a good technical introduction to the types of calculations that one does in cosmology, but may be overkill if you only want to use these simulations. The minimum technical knowledge cosmology that you will need to work with these simulations is an understanding of *comoving distances,* *proper/physical distances,* and *scale factors*. This page by `Ned Wright <https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_02.htm>`__ gives an overview of these topics. If you would like to look at alternative explanations, sections IV and V from Anthony Lewis's `lecture notes <https://cosmologist.info/teaching/Cosmology/Cosmology.pdf>`__ are also quite good.

Depending on what you want to do with these simulations, you may encounter values that have an :math:`h` factor in their units (e.g. :math:`h^{-1}M_\odot`). In this case, you should read `Croton (2013) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.4150.pdf>`__ (deligtfully titled "Damn You, Little :math:`h`!").

Lastly, you may be interested in reading a curated reivew of potential problems for the Lambda-CDM cosmological model in `Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin (2019) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04256.pdf>`__.  Be aware that many of these topics are as controversial as they are exciting. If you are interested in any of them, it would be best to read several papers on each "side" of the issue rather than a single author's summary.

Dark Matter Halo Background Reading
-----------------------------------

The Symphony simulation suite focuses on dark matter halos. Dark matter halos are massive, egg-shaped structures made out of dark matter that galaxies form within. They are about fifty times wider than the galaxies inside of them and can can be tens to thousands of times more massive.

These graduate-level `lecture notes <https://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/>`__ from Frank van den Bosch discuss the properties of dark matter halos, including their densities, shapes, spins, and the swarms of smaller subhalos that orbit inside them. Section 2.4 in `Mansfield & Aveztruz (2021) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08591.pdf>`__ gives a technical description of all the halo properties contained in Symphony's data sets.


Simulation Background Reading
-----------------------------

There are a number of review papers which give an overview of general topics related to dakr matter simulations. All of these papers have different goals, different target audiences, and different sets of topics. We have found that `Khulen et al. (2012) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5745.pdf>`__

Frank van den Bosch also has high-quality `lecture notes <http://www.astro.yale.edu/vdbosch/astro610_lecture20.pdf>`__ which will be useful to readers interested in understanding how simulations work and what their limitations are.
