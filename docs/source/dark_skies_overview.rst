Dark Skies
==========

The Dark Skies simulation suite is a series of large-volume, large-particle-count cosmological simulations designed to be used to make predictions which can be compared against surveys of the universe's large-scale struture. The flagship of this simulation suite is ds_a_14, an 8 Mpc/h box with 10240\ :sup:`3` particles.

The `Dark Skies webpage <https://darksky.slac.stanford.edu/about.html>`_ contains further information on the simulations, as well as links to data and analysis example code.
