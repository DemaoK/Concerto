The Buzzard Simulations
=======================

The Buzzard simulations `(De Rose et al. 2019) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12104.pdf>`_ are a series of mock galaxy catalogs designed to be compared against large-volume galaxy surveys and makes use of a method called Addgals that combines machine-learning with more traditional empirical modeling to quickly populate the simulation with galaxies `(Wechsler et al. 2022) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12105.pdf>`_. These mock catalogs recieved numerous methodlogical improvements in `To et al. (2024) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12104>`_. While these changes improved model output in many ways, in particular it fixed long-standing problems with Buzzard's galaxy clusters.
