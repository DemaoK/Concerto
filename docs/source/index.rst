GFC Simulation Suites
=====================

Welcome! This website hosts several simulation suites simulated by, or in collaboration with, the Galaxy Formation and Cosmology (GFC) group at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford University. You can learn about each of these simulation suites on their respective sites.

.. This website contains information on these :doc:`simulations <simulations>`, :doc:`the people who ran them <credits_acknowledgements>`, :doc:`how to access the data <data_access>`, and :doc:`how to interact with the data <getting_started>`. For experienced users, we have a :doc:`quickstart <quickstart>` page that will allow you to start you analysis as soon as possible. For students, we also have a page containing :doc:`lecture notes, slides, and review papers <background_reading>` that might be helpful to understand the jargon and concepts involved with analyzing these types of simulations.
