GFC Simulation Suites
=====================

This website is the hub for the simulations run by the Galaxy Formation and Cosmology (GCF) group at Stanford University. It contains summaries of large-scale :doc:`cosmological boxes <cosmological>` run by the group as well as links to external sites hosting data and detailed desriptions of the simulations. It also directly hosts data for several :doc:`zoom-in simulation suites <zoom_ins>`.

Much of the zoom-in data is stored in specialized data formats which save disk space, and are more conveint to use than traditional simulation outputs. These can be read with the :doc:`symlib <symlib_info>` library. This site contains full documentation for this library and many tutorials and worked examples.

For students we also have a page containing :doc:`lecture notes, slides, and review papers <background_reading>` that might be helpful to understand the jargon and concepts involved with analyzing these types of simulations.

The GFC group is lead by Professor Risa Wechsler. This website is currently maintained by Dr. Phil Mansfield and was written by Phil Mansfield, Deveshi Buch, and Bryne Hadnott.
